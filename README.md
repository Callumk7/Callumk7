### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can find links to my projects here. I am a self taught web developer who enjoys learning by doing. That means I really wanted to get my hands dirty and build some full stack applications from the ground up. 

I built playQ and Game Master with that in mind. playQ is a video game library and playlist manager with some friend and comment functionality, while Game Master is a note taking and publishing app geared towards the tabletop role playing space.
